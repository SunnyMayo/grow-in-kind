# grow-in-kind

A website for prompting and tracking positive actions and visualising personal growth.

## Concept

This website is my final project submission for the CS50 Intro to Computer Science course offered via Harvard and edX. 

The idea behind it is simple; that we, as people, and the world around us, benefit from acts of kindness towards ourselves and others. 

This is something I feel confident everyone believes, at least to some extent. But the world is complicated and sometimes these little actions can seem daunting, or insignificant, or be forgotten altogether.

To try and address this, this website targets what I believe to be 3 of the key challenges:

1. It can be hard to remember to do small, positive deeds
2. It can take time and effort to constantly do good things
3. There's often no clear 'reward' or recognition for good actions

The approach:

A page that prompts users with daily, easy to achieve 'acts' they can mark off as completed, while providing a visual reward that grows over time, supporting to develop these good actions into habits.
